instead of just showing all the projects in the list on the main page, we need to make at least 4 of them clickable into essentially a blog post / write up (which i will have to make) that discusses the project. We should use the most interesting ones for this obviously, but avoid active work projects (NDAExpress & Snackers). We can talk about sorter. we can talk about spooky.tf actually, even thought hat was ultimatley a failure, i think there were a lot of learning moments i can mention, and a lot of open source code did end up getting released. 

Start by structuing a stylistically nice template to use for the blog pages. add the routes and stuff.
